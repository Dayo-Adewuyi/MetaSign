## METASIGN

METASIGN is a decentralized signature request platform



### Problem

The current and most popular signature request platform are centralized and expensive. There have been many reports of these platforms suspending and deplatforming users, which has caused users to lose access to important activities.

Also, Some of these platforms are not available in some regions and countries which leaves  potential users in those regions/countries at a disadvantage.

### Solution
The solution built is a decentralized signature request platform

METASIGN allows user share documents and append signatures in a secured manner.

Users can access the platform from any region/country in the world without any fear of deplatforming or sale of information to third parties because the core and main features of the platform are smart contracts written and deployed to the blockchain network.



Some of the current features of METASIGN:

- Upload and Sharing of Files 
- Instant deployment of contracts for each agreement
- Instant minting of contract documents and signature
- Access to view uploaded documents by parties involved
- Access control for users



### Technologies

- Solidity - The smart contracts is written in solidity
- React.js - The frontend is built with React.js
- Metamask SDK - Metamask SDK is used to connect to Metamask flask
- Metamask snaps - Metamask snaps is used to send notifications to users on completion
- IPFS - IPFS is used to store files
- Linea - The smart contracts are deployed to Linea Mumbai

### ROADMAP

- users would be able to import minted documents into signature canvas
_ Revamp of UI
_ Launch to the public
